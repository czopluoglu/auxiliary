# Ludlow, L. H., & Oâ€™leary, M. (1999). Scoring omitted and not-reached items: 
#   Practical data analysis implications. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 
#   59(4), 615-630.

# Missing data is considered in two categories:
#   a) skipped/omitted: a student reads the item but decides not to respond
#   b) not reached: a student doesn't have the opportunity to response due 
#      to lack of timing.

# Definition of not-reach items: a string of consecutive items without responses 
# continuing through to the end of the assessment.
# Any other missing item that is not part of this long string can be 
# considered as skipped.

# Coding not-reached item as incorrect may lead biased item parameters
# such as items look more difficult than they are. So, by leaving NR items
# as missing in the original item calibration procedure
# should provide more accurate item parameter estimation.

# Once the item parameter calibration is done, and raw score-scale score
# conversion tables are formed, we can still count non-reached items
# as incorrect for the purpose of assigning a scale score to each individual.

# This is Strategy 4 discussed in the paper above.
